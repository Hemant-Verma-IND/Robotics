# Robotics Projects by Hemant Verma

Welcome to my Robotics Projects repository! This collection showcases a variety of robotics projects that I have developed during my time as a B.Tech student at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) Rourkela. As an avid enthusiast of robotics and a student of electrical engineering, I have created these projects to explore different aspects of robotics, from hardware design and control systems to software programming and artificial intelligence.

### 1. **Robo Race at IIT Bhubaneswar**

   - **Description:**
     I delved into the realm of robotics at Wissenaire, IIT Bhubaneswar's prestigious techfest. Our team participated in the Robo Race competition, where we built and controlled a robot car using an Arduino UNO, L298N Motor Driver, and HC05 Bluetooth Module. While our endeavor didn't clinch a trophy, the wealth of knowledge we amassed was truly priceless.

   - **Technologies Used:**
     - Arduino UNO
     - L298N Motor Driver
     - HC05 Bluetooth Module
     - Mobile phone for control interface

   - **Key Features:**
     - Controlled via a mobile phone using Bluetooth
     - Built in just 4 days
     - Tackled challenges in Arduino coding, chassis design, circuit construction, and microcontroller intricacies

   - **Experience:**
     The project required navigating through numerous challenges, including Arduino coding, chassis design, circuit construction, and understanding microcontroller intricacies. Despite being our maiden project, we forged ahead independently, fueled by our passion and resourcefulness. The ardor and determination we poured into our project, laboring through sleepless nights, culminated in the creation of our robot.

   - **Learnings:**
     From witnessing gripping competitions like robo wars, robo soccer, to engaging in aerotech battles, each moment at the techfest broadened our horizons and instilled invaluable lessons. This experience laid a solid foundation for our future pursuits in robotics.
